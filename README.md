- 👋 Hi, My name is Derik Dang - newbie, of-course...
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about GITHUB and its Action!  Never done any code ever in my life but my boss asked me to get involved to assist him setting up the GitHub Action for our internal coder, lucky me, right.
- 🌱 I’m currently self learning about GitHub Action, but unsure where to start....
- 💞️ I strongly believe in Teamwork and collaboration to get things done accordingly.
- 📫 How to reach me, ddang@multibeamcorp.com 24/7, anytime
